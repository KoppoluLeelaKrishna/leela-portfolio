      <p className="sub">
        I am a Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist with deep expertise across Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI systems, and Cloud Data Engineering. My career spans enterprise-scale data platforms, production ML systems, and frontier AI evaluation research.
        At Scale AI, I lead research on rigorous evaluation methodologies for frontier LLMs. I design scalable benchmarks across instruction-following, factuality, robustness, and fairness, and build reproducible evaluation pipelines that enable reliable cross-model comparison in collaboration with leading foundation model labs.
        Prior to this, at Palantir Technologies, I developed enterprise-grade Generative AI systems using RAG architectures, vector search, and LLM-based automation pipelines deployed on cloud-native infrastructure.
        At Infosys, I led AI/ML initiatives while architecting distributed data systems — building real-time streaming pipelines (Kafka + Spark), designing cloud-native ETL workflows, and deploying ML models across AWS and Azure environments.
        Earlier at Amazon, I worked across analytics, data engineering, and applied machine learning — building large-scale ETL pipelines, optimizing Redshift and EMR workloads, designing A/B experiments, and deploying forecasting and recommendation systems on multi-million-record datasets.
